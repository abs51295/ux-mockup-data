Based on the understanding developed by the analytics engine we see that
the function `AsyncClientHttpRequest` has been replaced by the function `ClientRequest`
in org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web >= 5.5.

# Do we include this? <HOLD>
#Please see the javadoc of the same here to understand the migration: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/ClientRequest.html,

<optional, might be able to do this>
As per analytics, the migration requires use of `ClientRequest.Builder` over `AsyncClientHttpRequestFactory` for request creation and `ClientRequest` over `AsyncClientHttpRequest`.
