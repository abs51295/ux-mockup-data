Since the user has not specified a version for "spring-boot-starter-web" in the
pom.xml, the version of that package which will be installed is the latest version
of the package available on Maven central, however the application was written
using an older version of the library that had the class "AsyncClientHttpRequest"
present in the API, however the same was deprecated and has now been removed
in favour of "ClientRequest" in SpringBoot 5.5(not a real version currently, highest in 5.1 where
this function is still in deprecated state).
